# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview

We've performed a comprehensive cleanup of the codebase to improve maintainability, reduce redundancy, and enhance error handling. The changes focus on streamlining the application structure, improving database handling, and providing better tools for development and deployment.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Consolidated Entry Points

- Created a unified management script (`manage.py`) that provides a command-line interface for common tasks:

  - Running the application
  - Setting up the database
  - Running migrations
  - Running tests
  - Creating environment files

- Removed redundant run scripts:

  - `run_app.py`
  - `run_with_db.py`
  - `debug.py`

- Enhanced `run.py` to be more robust with better error handling and environment detection

### 2. Improved Database Handling

- Updated `init_db.py` to be more efficient and handle edge cases better
- Enhanced `migrations/create_or_migrate_db.py` with better error handling and logging
- Improved database URI handling in `config.py` with a dedicated function
- Added verification of table creation to ensure database setup is successful

### 3. Better Configuration Management

- Enhanced `config.py` to better handle different environments
- Improved environment variable handling throughout the application
- Added logging for database configuration in production

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added comprehensive error handling in `app/__init__.py`
- Improved error handling in database initialization and migration scripts
- Added JSON error responses for API endpoints

### 5. Improved Deployment Support

- Updated `wsgi.py` with better server detection and fallback mechanisms
- Updated the Procfile to use the new management script
- Enhanced logging throughout the application

### 6. Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with instructions for using the new management script
- Added detailed command examples for common tasks

## How to Use the New Management Script

The `manage.py` script provides a unified interface for common tasks:

```
# Run the application
python manage.py run [--env development|production|testing] [--debug] [--port PORT]

# Initialize the database
python manage.py setup-db [--env development|production|testing]

# Run database migrations
python manage.py migrate [--env development|production|testing]

# Run tests
python manage.py test [--test-path PATH]

# Create or update .env file
python manage.py create-env [--env development|production|testing] [--db-url URL] [--force]
```

## Deployment Process

### Heroku Deployment

1. Ensure you have the necessary files:

   - `Procfile` (updated to use the management script)
   - `runtime.txt` (specifies Python version)
   - `requirements.txt` (includes all dependencies)

2. Create a Heroku app and PostgreSQL database:

   ```
   heroku create
   heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:mini
   ```

3. Deploy your application:

   ```
   git push heroku main
   ```

4. The `release` command in the Procfile will automatically run migrations.

### Local Development

1. Set up your environment:

   ```
   python manage.py create-env
   ```

2. Initialize the database:

   ```
   python manage.py setup-db
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python manage.py run --debug
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more comprehensive tests
2. Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
3. Add database seeding functionality to the management script
4. Consider implementing a more robust migration system with versioning
